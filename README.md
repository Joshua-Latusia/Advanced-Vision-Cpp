# Advanced-Vision-Cpp Intro to Neural Networks
This is the homework I together with Cezan von Meijenfeldt for the subject "Advanced Vision Cpp" during our minor (Vision and Robotics) in the 4th year of our Computer Science study.

This repo consists of 2 solutions with in total 3 projects.

The first solution is called "AdvancedVision"
  This solution has 2 projects "AdvancedVision" and "NeuralNetworkTest"
  
  "AdvancedVision"
  This project consist mostly of our own version of some OpenCv features like generating and drawing of boundingboxes and contours,
  calculating bending energy, chaincode and finally our own FloodFill algorithm which can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI4w_xM_gRM
  
  "NeuralNetworkTest"
  Simple test project for the testing the training of a neureal network.
  
The second solution is "FinalAssignment"
  This solution has 1 project with the same name.
  This was the final assignment we had to hand in for our final grade (which was a 7.5 out of 10)
  The idea of the project was to be able to distinct different object under a vision camera by differentiating between different features   of the objects like: Convexity, solidity and bending energy.

Final overal grade was 7.5 out of 10!
